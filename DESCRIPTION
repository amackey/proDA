Description: Account for missing values in label-free mass spectrometry data 
    without imputation. The package implements a probabilistic dropout model that
    ensures that the information from observed and missing values are properly 
    combined. It adds empirical Bayesian priors to increase power to detect
    differentially abundant proteins.
